_(Replace `USERNAME` above with the actual GitHub username/org once this
repo is pushed — the CI badge won't resolve until then.)_

A complete, original Salesforce Enterprise implementation — data model,
security architecture, declarative automation, reporting, and CI/CD — built
from scratch for a fictional B2B connectivity company, specifically so it
can be published and inspected in full.

**Nothing in this repository derives from real client work.** Object
names, security model, automation, and data are entirely original,
designed to demonstrate the same category of enterprise architecture
decisions that real client work involves, without any of the
confidentiality problems that come with actually showing real client work.
See [Why this project exists](PORTFOLIO/README.md#why-this-project-exists)
for the full reasoning.

| **Data model**       | 7 custom objects, standard-object extensions, 7 Record Types                              | [Entity relationship diagram](PORTFOLIO/diagrams/entity-relationship.md) |
| **Security**         | 11-role hierarchy, 10 Permission Sets → 6 Permission Set Groups, 3 sharing-rule policies  | [Security model diagram](PORTFOLIO/diagrams/security-model.md)           |
| **Automation**       | 6 declarative flows + 1 Approval Process, zero Apex triggers                              | [Automation flow diagrams](PORTFOLIO/diagrams/automation-flows.md)       |
| **Apps & reporting** | 3 role-specific Lightning Apps, 6 reports, 1 cross-functional dashboard                   | [Architecture overview](PORTFOLIO/diagrams/architecture-overview.md)     |
| **DevOps**           | One-command reproducible deploy, CI/CD pipeline, fictitious data + sample user generation | [Deployment guide](PORTFOLIO/deployment/README.md)                       |

Full technical design and every non-obvious decision, with reasoning:
**[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** and
**[PORTFOLIO/architecture/decision-log.md](PORTFOLIO/architecture/decision-log.md)**.

## Quick start

```bash
# One-time: connect a Dev Hub (interactive browser login)
sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub --alias MeridianDevHub

# Everything else: one command
./scripts/deploy-all.sh        # macOS/Linux/Git Bash
.\scripts\deploy-all.ps1       # Windows PowerShell
```

That creates a Scratch Org, deploys all metadata, loads realistic
fictitious data, and creates 7 sample users with role-appropriate access.
Full runbook: [PORTFOLIO/deployment/README.md](PORTFOLIO/deployment/README.md).

  technical interviews, work just as well as a self-guided tour)
- **[PORTFOLIO/diagrams/](PORTFOLIO/diagrams/)** — architecture, entity
  relationship, security, and automation diagrams (render natively on
  GitHub)
- **[PORTFOLIO/architecture/decision-log.md](PORTFOLIO/architecture/decision-log.md)**
  — 8 non-obvious design decisions, with the reasoning behind each

## Status

Metadata is complete and internally consistent (every cross-reference
verified against Salesforce's own metadata schema). Not yet deploy-tested
against a live org — see
[PORTFOLIO/deployment/README.md#known-risk-areas-on-first-deploy](PORTFOLIO/deployment/README.md)
for exactly which parts carry the most first-deploy risk and why, stated
plainly rather than glossed over.

project; reuse the patterns freely, the specific fictional company/data are
just there to make the patterns concrete.

## Contributing

This is a personal portfolio project, not soliciting external
contributions — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for why, and for
how to fork it if you want to build your own version.

## Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's been built and when.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what's planned next — deployment
validation, Experience Cloud, and the evidence library are the near-term
priorities.
